# All Stock Analisys

## Overview of project

- In this project we had to refactor the code on VBA to reduce analisys time on excel while keeping accuracy on results.

## Results

- After code was refactored we notice a huge improvemnt on run time from 34 seconds down to 4 seconds (I am using an old laptop).

- Results are still accurate

## Summary

- Refactoring have some major advantages for the end user, analisys can be run faster and can free up computational capacity for other tasks.
- Disadvantages are mostly for the person creating the code, there is a chance of ruining the code and having to deal with more errors, it takes longer to develop as well, and the end user has to wait more before it's relesead.
- In this case refactoring is the best way to go, since we can expect the end user to analize thousands of lines of data for his/her clients, a fast analisys time means a fast and convinient way to advice his/her clients.
- On my laptop, code ran a lot faster, this means, a fast analisys can be achived on any computer, new and old. There is no need to consider hardware, a light code is more likely to run faster and on more computers.
